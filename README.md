# Wordle-Reload

* The program starts by presenting the user with a randomly chosen word, which they must try to guess within a certain amount of time.

* As the user guesses words, the program keeps track of the time it takes them to guess each word and saves their best times for each word.

* In addition to the word guessing game, the program also includes a feature for tracking and managing stocks.

* Users can add their favorite stocks to a list, view information about each stock (e.g. current price, performance history), and see how their stocks are performing in real-time.

* The program provides a fun and interactive way for users to improve their vocabulary and stay informed about the stock market.
